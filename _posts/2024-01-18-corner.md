From Sylvia Townsend Warner's *The Corner That Held Them*:

>And here I am, she thought, fixed in the religious life like a candle on a spike.  I consume, I burn away, always lighting the same corner, always beleaguered by the same shadows; and in the end I shall burn out and another candle will be fixed in my stead.
