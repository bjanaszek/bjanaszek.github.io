From *The Big Rock Candy Mountain":

> So now there would be waiting again, as it seemed to her she had waited all the time she had known Bo.  Now there would sitting day after day busying herself with little unimportant things, but jumping at the slightest noise, running to the window at the slightest flash of movement along the south road.  There would be getting through the day somehow, anyhow, getting the boys to bed, sitting in the evenings to do fancy work or to read, and her ears, twice as alert as in the daylight, her mind twice as receptive to frettings and worry.  There would be dragging off to bed with the worries waiting for her to lie down, hanging over her like mosquitoes on a warm night.
