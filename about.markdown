This site is basically what the title says: Stuff Like That Over There--interesting things I see or read or think about that I want to note for perhaps a circle of friends to see.

Subject matter should be expansive: tech (particularly programming), literature, theology, rock climbing.

The site is managed via Jekyll, and deployed on my hosting service.
